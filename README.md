<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This page will help you install and build My Coaster app.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them. [Read more on how to do this here.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?package-manager=yarn)

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository and navigate into the project
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Leoksm/MyCoaster-app.git
   cd mycoaster-app
   ```
2. Install necessary packages and dependencies
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Install all pods (iOS only):
   ```sh
   cd ios && pod install
   ```

### Running on Simulator
